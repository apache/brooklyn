### Apache Brooklyn helps to model, deploy, and manage systems.

_This root project is a wrapper around subprojects. **See individual projects for recent changes.**_

It supports blueprints in YAML or Java, and deploys them to many clouds and other target environments.
It monitors those deployments, maintains a live model, and runs autonomic policies to maintain their health.

### Quick Start

This is the uber-repo. To build the entire codebase,
get this project and its sub-modules:

    git clone https://github.com/apache/brooklyn/
    cd brooklyn
    git submodule init
    git submodule update --remote --merge --recursive

And then, with jdk 1.8+ and maven 3.1+ installed:

    mvn clean install

However, this will not build the RPM/DEB packages, as well as the CLI. That's why we would recommand to use the
alternative: a docker container to build this project:

```bash
docker build -t brooklyn .
docker run -i --rm --name brooklyn -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
      --mount type=bind,source="${HOME}/.m2/settings.xml",target=/var/maven/.m2/settings.xml,readonly \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      -v ${PWD}:/usr/build -w /usr/build \
      brooklyn mvn clean install -Duser.home=/var/maven -Duser.name=$(id -un) -Drpm -Ddeb -Dclient -Ddocker
```

You can speed this up by using your local .m2 cache:
```bash
docker run -i --rm --name brooklyn -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      -v ${HOME}/.m2:/var/maven/.m2 \
      -v ${PWD}:/usr/build -w /usr/build \
      brooklyn mvn clean install -Duser.home=/var/maven -Duser.name=$(id -un) -Drpm -Ddeb -Dclient -Ddocker
```

The results are in `brooklyn-dist/dist/target/`, including a tar and a zip.
Or to run straight after the build, do:

```bash
pushd brooklyn-dist/karaf/apache-brooklyn/target/assembly/
./bin/start
```


### Non-Git Build

If you are performing a build on code not in source control (e.g. from a ZIP of source code, or after deleting SCM metadata),
you will need to manually set two variables that are normally inferred from the environment:

* `-DbuildNumber=manual`
* `-DscmBranch=manual`

You can set these properties to any value you wish. When using a checkout from git, the `buildNumber` is set to the SHA1 commit ID (short form)
of the containing project, and the `scmBranch` is set to the git branch.
